            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p><strong>Basic imports</strong></p>
            <p>The code imports hashlib, Fernet from cryptography.fernet and logging.</p>
            <p>Purposes of such imports are to hash paasswords with SHA-256, to use symmetric encryption from Fernet, and to monitor the logs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
            <p>By importing a logging library, the logging module is enabled to monitor any activities within the application with "logging".</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, the application will indication encryption status with SECURITY_ENABLED.</p>
            <p>Lastly, ENCRYPTION_KEY and cipher_suite will be available in the application.</p>
            
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Overall</strong></p>
            <p>Although the design lacked essential details, the outcome did work as I intended.</p>
            <p>However, since the fundamental knowledge and the base lack expertise, the testing has also been conducted with a very limited scope.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Understanding</strong></p>
            <p>Considering my understanding, I have not successfully conducted testings for requested scenarios.</p>
            <p>To conclude, considering the extent how I simplified the design, the final piece did work at some point, however, it was not enough to be an successful implementation of an application.</p>
