            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Overall</strong></p>
            <p>Considering the quality of findings, the expertise to a certain level is not achieved, and it needs to improve.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Understanding</strong></p>
            <p>Even though I cited and referred to some external knowledge, it cannot be confidently said that those were correctly implemented in my work.</p>
            <p>Despite the effort, my knowledge did not reach to a certain level to achieve successful outcome.</p>
            <p>However, I tried to simplify the whole process, which eventually was completed as Python code.</p>
            
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Overall</strong></p>
            <p>Although the design lacked essential details, the outcome did work as I intended.</p>
            <p>However, since the fundamental knowledge and the base lack expertise, the testing has also been conducted with a very limited scope.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Understanding</strong></p>
            <p>Considering my understanding, I have not successfully conducted testings for requested scenarios.</p>
            <p>To conclude, considering the extent how I simplified the design, the final piece did work at some point, however, it was not enough to be an successful implementation of an application.</p>
